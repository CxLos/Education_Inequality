# üìö Education Inequality: Exploring School Dropout Rates

## üìù Description

This project explores factors contributing to school dropout rates across the United States using a dataset containing school-level indicators such as funding, test scores, student-teacher ratios, and more. This interactive dashboard built with Plotly Dash enables users to visualize, filter, and interpret patterns related to education inequality and student retention.

## üß™ Methodology

- Dataset: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It contains over 1,000 schools with the following features:

    - Funding Per Student (USD)

    - Average Test Score (%)

    - Student-Teacher Ratio

    - Percent Low-Income Students

    - Percent Minority Students

    - Internet Access (%)

    - Dropout Rate (%), among others

- **Preprocessing**:

    - Cleaned missing or inconsistent data

    - Standardized numerical features

    - Encoded categorical variables like school type and grade level

- **Modeling**:

    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

    - Correlation heatmaps and regression modeling to identify key drivers of dropout rates

## Results


### üîç Insights

    - Schools with higher funding per student often report lower dropout rates.

    - Dropout rates are significantly higher in schools with a greater percentage of low-income or minority students.

    - Better internet access is associated with improved academic performance and retention.

### üåü Feature Importance

1. Percent Low-Income

2. Funding Per Student

3. Student-Teacher Ratio

4. Internet Access Percent

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of educational disparities and their impact on student retention. The findings support the importance of equitable resource allocation to improve student outcomes and reduce dropout rates across U.S. schools.
